# Customizing Patches

Here's the [sample env](#sample-env) to help you. Reminder to check if you have [workflow permissions](#workflow-permission).

**Note - If you want to use or will be using `Automated` method to patch, please do not define anything inside `ENVS`. You are free to use `.env` file to do so.**

## Default

If you don't define anything in `.env` file or `ENVS` in `GitHub Secrets`, these configurations will be used:

- YouTube & YouTube Music apps will be patched
- With latest versions recommended by ReVanced
- Using latest resources provided by ReVanced
- With all patches included except for universal patches

**Note that _MicroG_ won't be released by default and you've to use `EXTRA_FILES` config for that to happen.**

## Configurations

## Customization

1. **Officially** Supported values for **APP_NAME\*** are listed under `Code` column [here](../../../changelogs/auto/apps/README.md#supported-apps).
   <br>Note that the page syncs itself with the usage of `PATCHES_JSON_DL` resources in the `.env` file.
   <br>The sources of original APKs are from one of these apkmirror, apkpure, uptodown & apksos sites. I'm not responsible for any damaged caused.
   If you know any better/safe source to download clean. Open a discussion.

   <br>`*` - <a id="any-patch-apps"></a>You can also patch any other app which is **not** supported officially.To do so, you need to provide
   few more inputs to the tool which are mentioned below. These config will override the sources config from the tool.

   ```ini
   <APP_NAME>_DL_SOURCE=<apk-link-to-any-of-the-suppored-scraper-sites>
   <APP_NAME>_PACKAGE_NAME=<package-name-of-the-application>
   ```

   You can also provide `DL` to the clean apk instead of providing `DL_SOURCES` as mentioned in this [note](#app-dl).

   ```ini
   <APP_NAME>_DL=<direct-download-apk-link-to-any-site>
   <APP_NAME>_PACKAGE_NAME=<package-name-of-the-application>

   <br>Please verify the source of original APKs yourself with links provided. I'm not responsible for any damage
   caused.If you know any better/safe source to download clean. Open a discussion.

2. By default, script build the latest version mentioned in `patches.json` file.
3. Remember to download the **_Microg_**. Otherwise, you may not be able to open YouTube/YouTube Music.
4. <a id="patch-apps"></a>By default, tool will build only `youtube,youtube_music`. To build other apps supported by patching
   resources.Add the apps you want to build in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=<APP_NAME>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=youtube,twitter,reddit
   ```
5. <a id="existing-downloaded-apks"></a>If APKMirror or other apk sources are blocked in your region or script
   somehow is unable to download from apkmirror. You can download apk manually from any source. Place them in
   `/apks` directory and provide environment variable in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format.
   ```ini
    EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=<Comma,Seperate,App,Name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
    EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=youtube,youtube_music
   ```
   If you add above. Script will not download the `YouTube` & `YouTube Music` apks from internet and expects an apk in
   `/apks` folder with names `youtube.apk` & `youtube_music.apk` (apk naming format - `<APP_NAME>.apk`) respectively.
6. <a id="personal-access-token"></a>If you run script again & again. You might hit GitHub API limit. In that case you can provide your Personal
   GitHub Access Token by adding a secret `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `GitHub secrets`.
7. <a id="global-resources"></a>You can provide Direct download to the resource to used for patching apps `.env` file
   or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format -
   ```ini
    GLOBAL_CLI_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-cli
    GLOBAL_PATCHES_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/releases/latest
    GLOBAL_PATCHES_JSON_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.190.0
    GLOBAL_INTEGRATIONS_DL=local://integrations.apk
   ```
   Resources downloaded from envs and will be used for patching for any **APP_NAME**.
   Unless provided different resource for the individual app.<br><br>
   Tool also support resource config at app level. You can patch A app with X resources while patching B with Y
   resources.
   This can be done by providing Direct download link for resources for app.<br>
   Example:
   ```ini
    YOUTUBE_CLI_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-cli
    YOUTUBE_PATCHES_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/latest
    YOUTUBE_PATCHES_JSON_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.187.1
    YOUTUBE_INTEGRATIONS_DL=local://inotia00-integrations.apk
   ```
   With the config tool will try to patch YouTube with resources from inotia00 while other global resource will used
   for patching other apps.<br>
   If you have want to provide resource locally in the apks folder. You can specify that by mentioning filename
   prefixed with `local://`.<br>
   _Note_ - The link provided must be direct DLs, unless they are from GitHub.
   _Note_ - Some of the patch sources (like inotia00) may provide **-** seperated patches while some (ReVanced) shifted to
   Space formatted patches. Use `SPACE_FORMATTED_PATCHES` to define the type of patches.
8. <a id="global-keystore-file-name"></a>If you don't want to use default keystore. You can provide your own by
   placing it inside `/apks` folder. And adding the filename of `keystore-file` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub
secrets` in the format -
   ```ini
    GLOBAL_KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=revanced.keystore
   ```
   Tool also support providing secret key at app level. You can sign A app with X key while signing B with Y
   key.<br>
   Example:
   ```ini
    YOUTUBE_KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=youtube.keystore
   ```
   Note - If you are using your own keystore and it was generated with cli v4, add
   Example:
   ```ini
    GLOBAL_OLD_KEY=False
   ```
   If you are using different key for different apps. You need to specify at app level.
   ```ini
   YOUTUBE_OLD_KEY=False
   ```
9. <a id="global-options-file"></a>If you don't want to use default `apks/options.json` file. You can
   provide your own by placing it inside `apks` folder and adding the name of `options-file` in `.env` file
   or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format.

   ```ini
    GLOBAL_OPTIONS_FILE=my_options.json
   ```

   Tool also support configuring at app level.<br>

   Example:

   ```ini
    YOUTUBE_OPTIONS_FILE=my_cool_yt_options.json
   ```

   Note that this customization isn't available in the `RVX-Builds` tasker project. For now, use the `Universal` option
   for Patch Options to include options.json entries from all patch resources being used.

10. <a id="global-archs-to-build"></a>You can build only for a particular arch in order to get smaller apk files. This
    can be done with by adding comma separated `ARCHS_TO_BUILD` in `.env` file or `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the
    format.

    ```ini
     GLOABAL_ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,x86_64
    ```

    Tool also support configuring at app level.<br>

    Example:

    ```ini
     YOUTUBE_ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
    ```

    _Note_ -

    1. Possible values are: `arm64-v8a`,`armeabi-v7a`,`x86_64`,`x86`.
    2. Make sure the patching resource (CLI) support this feature.

11. <a id="extra-files"></a>If you want to include any extra file (apks only) to the Github upload (releases). Set comma arguments
    in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format -
    ```ini
    EXTRA_FILES=<url>@<appName>.apk
    ```
    Example:
    ```ini
     EXTRA_FILES=https://github.com/inotia00/mMicroG/releases/latest@Mmicrog.apk,https://github.com/inotia00/VancedMicroG/releases/tag/v0.2.27.230755@Vmicrog.apk,https://github.com/revanced/revanced-integrations@integrations.apk
    ```
12. <a id="custom-exclude-patching"></a>If you want to exclude any patch. Set comma separated patch in `.env` file
    or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format -
    ```ini
